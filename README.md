# Centralized-Test-Automation-System
1.1 Introduction

Web applications are leading application category in many domains such as ecommerce, medicine, finance, people management and education. There are many free and commercial testing tools available in the market for automating testing of web applications. One of the major drawback of available tools is free tools are not provided features to work as a team. Main reason for this limitation is that all the tester’s tools are placed in theirs computers locally and there is no interconnection among tools. In some cases, the test report is created using Microsoft Excel. In addition to above analysing past test case results become cumbersome with traditional local testing system lack of centralized test and test result management system open an opportunity to testers to cheat on test case execution and result reporting. Although the tester may state that the test case was executed, it might not be executed against the new release of the software. Another emerging aspect in the web application quality assurance is test automation. When automating web application testing, testers have to go through coding activities. They have to know a programing language like java, ruby, PHP, Perl or python. These automation data is also saved in tester’s local computer most of the times. When the local machine hard disk stops performing due to defect or damage, then the tester’s whole data will lost. 

As mentioned in above paragraphs, lot of problems are occurring because testing tool is located in the tester’s machine. This project aims to introduce a centralized web application testing and test automation system to overcome above mentioned problems. In a centralized system, managers and supervisors don’t need to wait until email or the excel sheet comes to them. They can check it through the system. Testers can’t cheat on testing and reporting. Testers are not needed to do code because the proposed tool will provide a GUI for the tester to automate the test. In any defect or failures at the local machine, no data will be lost since data is stored and backed up in the centralized server.


1.2 Background & Motivation

When the automating the web application testing is not centralized or doesn’t have a
GUI [5], testers will be faced to few problems. Even though test cases are executed
analyse test results are not an easy task for users. Complication of the report analyse
procedure (checking all emails and excel sheets), managers and supervisors who in
charge, may miss important details and it can be misleading when taking decisions.
Most of the time manual calculations are needed to be carried out by counting passed
and failed test cases of test runs. Generally reporting part is done by excel sheets and
share using emails. However tester are good at testing, testers may do mistakes or
testers may cheat on test case execution. One of significant problem in test automating
is testers have to familiar with a programing language. It will be a nightmare to the
testers. Testers have to use loops, if conditions, check errors etc. And also testers will
be made mistakes when create scripts for automate web application testing. In a case of
a failure in a local machine, tester’s data will be lost or can’t continue the process until
machine is fixed.
In Sri Lankan IT companies are not used centralized test automation systems due to few
reasons. First reason is there is no proper free tools for test automations. Whatever there
are exist free tools that tools are restricted mostly requires functionalities from user.
That features are come with the commercial version of that tools or just only for a
limited time period.
